ScoreMD: Score-based Generative Model for Accelerating Molecular Dynamics Simulation

TODO:

- [ ] Evaluation metrics of sampled trajectory
    - [ ] RDF (check bin size)
    - [ ] RMSD
    - [ ] # hydrogen bonds
    - [ ] bond lengths & angles
- [ ] Save sampled trajectory to lammpstraj and visualize
- [ ] Train on larger interval
- [ ] Add MD refinement step
- [ ] Use denoise pretrained model (?)
